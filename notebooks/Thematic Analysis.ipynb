    "🧠 Thematic Analysis Interpretation of Customer Reviews\n",
    "We applied TF-IDF keyword extraction followed by manual theme grouping across user reviews of three major Ethiopian banking apps. The following insights emerged:\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 1. Common Themes Across All Banks\n",
    "Each bank exhibited four primary themes:\n",
    "\n",
    "User Interface & Experience (UI/UX): Keywords like app, good app, application, and easy highlight how users consistently comment on app usability and design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Requests: Terms such as update, need, and option show that users are actively requesting improvements or new functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction Performance: Keywords like transaction, transfer, and slow suggest that performance—particularly in financial operations—is a consistent pain point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other: This category captures more general sentiment (e.g., good, nice, bad) or unrelated terms. These reviews are often vague but still valuable for tone assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 2. Bank-Specific Observations\n",
    "🟦 Bank of Abyssinia\n",
    "UI/UX concerns are fairly prominent, with repeated mentions of bad app and crash, indicating stability issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction performance is discussed with keywords like slow, suggesting delays or failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature gaps like developer option were uniquely mentioned here, hinting at more technical user expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "🟧 Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE)\n",
    "App simplicity is appreciated (easy, nice), but transaction and feature issues are still present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive feedback like wow and use appear frequently, suggesting a broader user base with varying experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "🟩 Dashen Bank\n",
    "Receives relatively more positive sentiment (keywords like super, fast, amazing) in the “Other” category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still shares common concerns in UI/UX and feature requests, but the tone appears slightly more optimistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Summary\n",
    "This analysis shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "A shared set of user priorities across all three apps (ease of use, features, transaction performance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Opportunities to improve app stability, introduce requested features, and enhance transaction reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slight tone differences per bank, with Dashen skewing more positive and BOA more negative in sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "These thematic insights should guide targeted UX and engineering improvements for each banking app."
